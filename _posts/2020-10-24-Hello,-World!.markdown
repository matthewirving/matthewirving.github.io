Hello and welcome to my first blog post! This is the first post on my brand new website and my very first blog post. The goal of this website and by extension blog posts is to document my personal projects, and to share things about myself. I will most likely post irregularly with posts coming whenever I make some good progress on a project, or if I find something particularly interesting that I'd like to share. 

Today I'm going to be talking about what I had been doing up until this point as I haven't been documenting any work at all. This website is actually apart of the work I had planned this week. I had made my old one from scratch during quarantine with just HTML, basic CSS, and of course W3schools tutorials. Because of how ugly it was I decided to make a new one from scratch as it couldn't really be salvaged. I searched around and eventually settled on something called "Jekyll". Their website can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/). As described by them Jekyll is a static site generator that is based off of Ruby. A very nice thing about Jekyll is that it has very nice integration with GitHub Pages which makes me very happy since GitHub Pages is very free, and I already know how to use it. 

Jekyll has honestly suprised me at how easy it was to set it up. At the time of writing this it's 7:16PM right now and the website is essentially finished. A large factor of this is that Jekyll relies on premade or homemade "themes" in order to generate your website. The theme can come with default page layouts that you can go in and edit to your satisfaction. The default theme however feels very default so I went searching around for a better one. Now personally I hate having to use someone else's work in a capacity like this but my dog could probably design a better UX than me. I just can't make stuff pretty like others can honestly. I eventually found [this](https://github.com/themefisher/kross-jekyll) theme which instantly grabbed my attention with its colors and formatting. After a little retrofitting I think it looks pretty nice but of course feel free to let me know. 

Jekyll runs off of Ruby which is a language I have exactly zero experience with, so I was pleasantly surprised at the minimal amount of technical setbacks. The installation instructions are pretty well documented on the Jekyll website and I followed them easily. Jekyll also gives you the ability to test your website on your local network which was amazing for me. The only rub I had was that when I was trying to initialize the website the first time my version of Ruby was actually too new for the website to work properly. The versions required were ">2.7.dev and <2.2". I had version "2.7.p?????" so that was kind of annoying. I surfed Google for a while and was able to find out how to downgrade my version of Ruby. After wasting 30 minutes I decided to just download an installer for version 2.6.6 and it did the trick.

That's all for now, seeya next time.
