My name is Matthew Irving I am 19 years old from Montgomery, NJ. I am currently a Sophmore at Rutgers University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. A couple of the clubs I'm involved with at Rutgers are the club Rugby team, IEEE, Some of my passions include micro-controllers, hardware and software development, and retro computers. I have always been passsionate about computers and tech in general from a very young age. I would usually disassemble anything that would fit my Philip's head screwdriver and try to see how it works. Granted, a 10 year old barely knows how to basically anything useful or knowledgable so most of the time the only thing id learn is from whatever my Dad had told me after finding the crime scene. But the zest to figure out how things work has only grown since then, and so has my toolkit.
